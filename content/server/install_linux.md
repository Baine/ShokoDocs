## Is Shoko Server Mandatory?

The short answer is **Yes**.

Shoko Server is the back-end of the entire Shoko suite, which means every single program and plugin provided uses it for accessing and maintaining your anime collection. This makes Shoko Server **mandatory** and also means Shoko Server **must be running** to use any of the programs or plugins that connect to it. With the exception of file importing, Shoko Server is no more resource intensive than other programs you probably have running in the background so you don't need to worry about Shoko Server eating up resources.
