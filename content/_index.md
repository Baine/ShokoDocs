## Navigating Shoko Docs

Shoko Docs was designed to be easy to navigate and find the content you are looking for. Our navigation menu on the left lists **all currently available pages**. If the section or program / plugin you are looking for is not covered, you can either add it yourself (see below) or make a request in our Discord server for someone on staff to write it. You can also use the **search function** in the top-right to quickly find your desired content, each result is only listed once regardless of how many matches on a page were found. 

## Help Make Shoko Docs Even Better!

Like Shoko itself, Shoko Docs is open-source, hosted on Github and mostly written in {{< external-link link="https://www.markdownguide.org/" text="Markdown" >}} making it incredibly easy to contribute. We've also created an [examples](link) page to document some of the custom additions we've made to help new users create content for Shoko Docs. 

To keep uniformity, we will ask that the following standards for any submission be applied when possible. 

- Indenting is 1 Tab / 2 Spaces.
- Unless already used, do not use abbreviations.
- All explanations of functions must be clear and detailed.
- Provide examples when and if needed.
- Code commenting is optional.

If you have questions or need help, please contact us on Discord.
