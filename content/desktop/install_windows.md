## Do I Need To Install Shoko Desktop?

The short answer is **Yes**.

Shoko Desktop is the front-end that is used to manage the Shoko environment. While the WebUI is progressing, the desktop is still your first and best place to go to to manage Shoko.

Shoko Desktop is also not a standalone system, it requires you to run Shoko Desktop on another (or the same) device. Think of Shoko Desktop as an interface for the magic the server portion does!

## Installing Shoko Desktop

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to download and install [Shoko Server](https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/install_windows.html). Without Shoko Server, Desktop is dead in the water.

The installation process is straight forward. You install Desktop like any other application. If you haven't already download the client from the [Shoko Website](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/). Afterwards, run the EXE that's in the ZIP file, you might have to run this as Administrator, however afterwards you will be able to run it as a normal user.

## First Run

With Shoko Server, you'll be able to run the Shoko Desktop. The first thing you will be asked for is to input the IP your server is hosted on.

Fill in the IP of the server you are using, this could be the same device, or a remote server. After that press "Test and Save"

A login field will pop up, by default you can use the username "Default" and an empty password to log in. If everything went well, you should now be on the Settings page of the desktop. Congratulations!
